YouTube Reaper is intended to be a no nonsense file downloader for YouTube videos.

## Usage
Provide YouTube Reaper with a YouTube video URL. If the link provided is valid, the file will be downloaded and saved to your computer.

Four file quality options are available:

#### Audio Only
- 48 Kbps
- 128 Kbps

#### Video with Audio
- 360p
- 720p

If you are unsure what the options mean, higher numbers indicate a file of higher quality, but of greater size. 

You may specify a directory to save your files to, the path for which is retained in "settings.txt". If you choose not do so, a directory named "youtube_downloads" is created locally instead.

## Running the application
To execute: 

1. Open your terminal of choice and navigate to the directory which contains your YouTube Reaper files.

2. Enter the following command:

```Bash
    python main.py
```

That's it, you're good to go!

## Version Control
YouTube Reaper is dependent on the following:

- [python](https://docs.python.org/3/) 3.9.6
- [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/user/install.html) 11.0.1
